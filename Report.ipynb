The dataset was assessed for missing values, but none existed for all features. Concerning the validation of each column, the following was done:\n","- There were a total of 879 unique product IDs, as expected. However, values were of the numerical type, so they were changed to the character type.\n","- The product category column was of character type, and each value was one of the following 11 categories:\n","\t1. Equipment\n","\t2. Toys\n","\t3. Snack\n","\t4. Supplements\n","\t5. Bedding\n","\t6. Medicine\n","\t7. Housing\n","\t8. Food\n","\t9. Clothes\n","\t10. Accessory\n","\t11. Grooming\n","- The values in the sales column were of the character type, each with a \"\\$\" sign and a comma separating thousands digits. The aforementioned characters were stripped, and the values were changed to numerical type. No negative or zero values were present.\n","- All prices were numerical, without any negative or zero values, as expected.\n","- There were a total of 879 unique vendor IDs of the character type, as expected.\n","- The pet size column was of character type, and each value was one of the following five sizes, as expected:\n","\t1. extra_small\n","\t2. small\n","\t3. medium\n","\t4. large\n","\t5. extra_large\n","- There were 6 types of pets: fish, cat, dog, bird, hamster, and rabbit.\n","- Ratings were integers ranging from 1 to 10, as expected.\n","- Rebuy column values were binary, as expected. But they were changed to boolean values for greater clarity.\n","\n","After that, a new feature was added to the dataset, which is the number of sold items for each sales record. It is calculated as follows:\n","$$ n\\_sold\\_items = {sales \\over price}$$\n","This will enable analyzing the number of products being purchased more than once.\n","\n","Last but not least, all rows with hamster and rabbit types were removed. These totaled 46 sales records. The analysis was carried out on the remaining dataset, which comprises 833 sales records."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"714a7083-7a43-4b0b-8ed4-2675efc87691","metadata":{"tags":[]},"source":["## Data Discovery and Visualization\n","\n","\n","### **How many products are being purchased more than once?**\n","\n","The number of sales records corresponding to the products that are purchased more than once is slightly less than the number of sales records for the products that are purchased once.\n","\n","![Count of Sales Records by Product Rebought Status](data/count_of_sales_records_by_product_rebought_status.png)\n","\n","However, upon digging deeper, we find that the total number of sold products that are purchased more than once exceeds that of products purchased once, hitting a value ofÂ **1,241,550**. Despite that being said, both categories share approximately half of the total number of sold items, which is around 2,400,000 items.\n","\n","![Total Number of Sold Products by Rebuy Status](data/total_number_of_sold_products_by_rebuy_status.png)\n","\n","### **Do the products being purchased again have better sales than others?**\n","\n","As the marketing team wants to know whether products being purchased again have better sales than others, we should inspect how the sales values are distributed in both cases of repurchase status. When examining the sales values for products purchased again versus those purchased once, we found no significant difference between the two categories. Both have a majority of sales values between \\$57,000 and \\$179,000, and the centrality measures for the sales values are also similar. The total sales value for products purchased again is slightly lower than that of products purchased once, at \\$45,587,000 compared to \\$51,125,000.\n","\n","_That being said, we can assert with confidence that the fact that the product is being purchased again does not imply better sales value._\n","\n","It is worth noting that further analysis is needed to see whether, upon drilling down by each product category or pet type, we see a significant difference in sales values between products purchased again and products purchased once.\n","\n","![Distribution of Sales Values by Rebuy Status](data/distribution_of_sales_values_by_rebuy_status.png)\n","\n","### **What products are more likely to be purchased again for different types of pets?**\n","\n","For the reason that we want to know which product has the highest likelihood to be purchased again for each pet type, let's see how many products in general are sold for each pet type and for each rebuy status. This will allow for seeing the big picture before diving into each product category.\n","\n","![Total Sold Items by Rebuy Status For Each Pet Type](data/total_sold_items_by_rebuy_status_for_each_pet_type.png)\n","\n","\n","When looking at which pet types are more likely to have products purchased again, we found that bird, cat, and dog products all had a high number of items purchased again. However, bird products had the highest likelihood of being purchased again relative to products purchased once, with the number of items purchased again being approximately five times that of products purchased once.\n","\n","![Number of Sold Items Across Different Rebought Product Categories For Each Pet Type](data/number_of_sold_items_across_different_rebought_product_categories_for_each_pet_type.png)\n","\n","Upon breaking down the data by product category for each pet type, we found that equipment was the top category for repurchased bird products, as demonstrated in the above figure. For other pet types, and for products that are purchased again:\n","\n","- The majority of cat products sold are in the **Food** category.\n","- The majority of the items sold in the **Housing** category are dog-related. The Equipment and Clothing categories, on the other hand, have a relatively high number of sold products.\n","- Fish products, which have the least number of sold items in general, have **Toys** as the majority of sold items.\n","\n","\n","### Recommendations:\n","\n","Based on these findings, we recommend that the team include products being purchased again in the pet box subscription, as they make up a significant portion of total sales and have similar sales values to products that have already been purchased. Concerning the product categories of products being purchased again, it is advisable to focus on \"Equipment\" bird products. Furthermore, consider including \"Food\" cat products and \"Housing\" dog products. Finally, it may be worth conducting further analysis on the relationship between the rating of the product and the sales and on the rating of the product and the likelihood of it being purchased again."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bfe721de","metadata":{},"source":[]}],"metadata":{"editor":"DataCamp Workspace","kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
